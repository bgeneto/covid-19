# covid-19
This project consists of a single python 3 script file that scrapes the web for coronavirus (covid-19) data and process it in order to output .png graphics files, mp4 animated bar chart race, and .dat data files that can be used by several plotting softwares, like gnuplot. 

## Installing

Just clone this repository, install the required (prerequisites) packages and execute the python script.

```
cd $HOME
git clone https://github.com/bgeneto/covid-19.git
```

### Prerequisites

This script relies on several python packages, namely: numpy, matplotlib and pandas. See requirements.txt 
You can install all prerequisites by running the following command:

```
cd $HOME/covid-19
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Additionally, if you want to create HTML5 bar chart racing graphs (-a option), you need to have ffmpeg already installed on your system. A 64-bit binary for Windows is provided in the link below, you have to download it mannualy if using Windows OS and then paste/extract the binary (exe) to same directory as this python script.

[FFmpeg Builds](https://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/)

OR 

[direct link](https://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/win64/static/ffmpeg-4.2.2-win64-static.zip)

As always, life is easier on linux, just run your distribution install command (apt, yum etc...) and you are ready to go.

```
sudo apt update && sudo apt install ffmpeg -y
```


## Running the code

The script generates a .ini config file in the first run. You can, as usual, edit this config file to satisfy your needs. 
There is also an input file named 'countries.txt' where you can select all the countries you want to scrape info about covid-19 number of cases, number of deaths, cases per million people, and all other info generated by the script. The generated files are outputed to the current script directory in a folder named 'output'.

```
python covid19scraper.py 
```

OR 

```
python covid19scraper.py -p -a html -l pt
```


## Script options

```
covid19scraper.py [-h] [-v] [-a {gif,html,mp4,png}] [-f] [-l LANG] [-p] [--no-con] [--no-dat] [--no-png]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v, --version         show program's version number and exit
  -a {gif,html,mp4,png}, --animate {gif,html,mp4,png}
                        create (html, mp4, png or gif) animated bar racing
                        charts (requires ffmpeg)
  -f, --force           force download and regeneration of all data
  -l LANG, --lang LANG  output messages in your preferred language (es, pt, de, ...)
  -p, --parallel        execute faster by running some functions in parallel
  --no-con              do not check for an active Internet connection
  --no-dat              do not output dat files
  --no-png              do not output png image files
